# ShiftScraper Improvements

## Summary
The `shiftscraper.py` script has been improved to better handle PDF extraction issues, including concatenated times, longer turnus names, and shifts that span across day boundaries.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Turnus Name Extraction
**Problem**: The script had hardcoded logic that only captured specific patterns like "OSL_Ramme_01" but would miss longer or different turnus names like "OSL 11 Østre Linje".

**Solution**: 
- Added `extract_turnus_name()` method that dynamically extracts all words after "Turnus:" until a known separator is found
- Now captures complete turnus names regardless of length
- Example: Now correctly captures "OSL_11_Østre_Linje" instead of just "OSL_11"

### 2. ✅ Concatenated Time Values
**Problem**: Times like "19:01" and "4:24" were being extracted as "19:014:24" (stuck together without separator).

**Solution**:
- Added `split_concatenated_times()` method using regex pattern `(\d{1,2}:\d{2})` to find and split time values
- Handles patterns like:
  - `19:014:24` → `['19:01', '4:24']`
  - `8:0016:00` → `['8:00', '16:00']`

### 3. ✅ Shifts Spanning Day Boundaries  
**Problem**: Shifts that span from one day to another have a thin vertical line between them in the PDF. Text extraction would capture both times in one cell, but the script didn't know which time belonged to which day.

**Solution**:
- Added cell boundary detection in `plasseringslogikk_tid()`
- Checks if extracted text extends beyond current cell's x-coordinate boundary
- When a split time (e.g., `['19:01', '4:24']`) crosses cell boundaries:
  - First time (`19:01`) placed in current day
  - Second time (`4:24`) placed in next day
- Properly handles week boundaries (Sunday → Monday next week)

### 4. ✅ Improved Text Extraction Parameters
**Problem**: Default tolerance values (`x_tolerance=1, y_tolerance=1`) were too strict, causing text elements to be missed or split incorrectly.

**Solution**:
- Increased tolerances to `x_tolerance=3, y_tolerance=2`
- Better captures complete words and numbers that might have slight spacing variations

### 5. ✅ Shift Codes Spanning Cell Boundaries
**Problem**: Shift codes like "1511-N05 01" were being split across cells. The "01" part would appear in the next day's column and bleed into that cell, leaving it incorrectly in the wrong day.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `plasseringslogikk_dagsverk()` to detect when shift code fragments appear in adjacent cells
- Checks if adjacent cell is empty and contains a short numeric code (like "01")
- Checks if previous cell's shift code ends with pattern like "-N05" indicating likely continuation
- Appends the fragment to the correct day instead of placing it in the wrong cell
- Example: "1511-N05" in Monday + "01" in Tuesday → "1511-N05 01" in Monday, Tuesday empty

### 6. ✅ Shift Codes for Spanning Shifts
**Problem**: When shifts span days (e.g., Thursday night to Friday morning), the shift code in the PDF sometimes appears in the second day's column, but should be associated with the first day.

**Solution**:
- Detects spanning shifts by checking if current day has only end-time and previous day has start-time
- Places shift code with the day that has the start time
- Example: Thursday "23:48" + Friday "7:25" with shift "1325" → shift "1325" assigned to Thursday

### 7. ✅ Single-Digit Metadata Filtering
**Problem**: Single-digit numbers like "3", "9" from the PDF (possibly week numbers or other metadata) were being incorrectly captured as shift codes.

**Solution**:
- Added filter to skip single-digit numeric values when they're not clearly part of a valid shift code
- Valid shift codes are typically 4+ digits or patterns like "1511-N05"
- Prevents spurious data from polluting the shift code field

### 8. ✅ Multiple Shift Codes in Same Cell
**Problem**: When multiple shift code fragments were placed in the same cell, the second one would overwrite the first instead of being appended.

**Solution**:
- Modified placement logic to append to existing dagsverk value with space separator
- Now correctly handles cells with multiple code fragments like "3 9" (before filtering) 
- Prevents data loss from overwriting

## Before vs After Examples

### Example 1: OSL_11 Turnus Name

**Before:**
- Turnus name extracted as: `OSL_11`
- Missing: "Østre Linje"

**After:**
- Turnus name extracted as: `OSL_11_Østre_Linje` ✅

### Example 2: Shift Code Spanning Cells (Week 4, Monday-Tuesday)

**Before:**
```json
{
  "OSL_11_Østre_Linje": {
    "4": {
      "1": {
        "ukedag": "Mandag",
        "tid": ["21:56", "6:41"],
        "dagsverk": "1511-N05"  // Missing "01"
      },
      "2": {
        "ukedag": "Tirsdag",
        "tid": [],
        "dagsverk": "01"  // ❌ Wrong: "01" bleeding into Tuesday
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "OSL_11_Østre_Linje": {
    "4": {
      "1": {
        "ukedag": "Mandag",
        "tid": ["21:56", "6:41"],
        "dagsverk": "1511-N05 01"  // ✅ Complete shift code
      },
      "2": {
        "ukedag": "Tirsdag",
        "tid": [],
        "dagsverk": ""  // ✅ Empty as it should be
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Spanning Shift Code Placement (Week 4, Thursday-Friday)

**Before:**
```json
{
  "OSL_11_Østre_Linje": {
    "4": {
      "4": {
        "ukedag": "Torsdag",
        "tid": ["23:48", "7:25"],
        "dagsverk": "3 9"  // ❌ Wrong: spurious single digits
      },
      "5": {
        "ukedag": "Fredag",
        "tid": [],
        "dagsverk": "1325"  // Shift code in wrong day
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "OSL_11_Østre_Linje": {
    "4": {
      "4": {
        "ukedag": "Torsdag",
        "tid": ["23:48", "7:25"],
        "dagsverk": "1325"  // ✅ Shift code correctly placed with start time
      },
      "5": {
        "ukedag": "Fredag",
        "tid": [],
        "dagsverk": ""  // ✅ Empty (single digits filtered out)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Improvements in Code

### New Methods Added:
1. **`extract_turnus_name(text_objects, word_pos)`** - Dynamically extracts complete turnus names
2. **`split_concatenated_times(text)`** - Splits concatenated time values using regex
3. **`extract_shift_code(text)`** - Cleans shift codes (reserved for future enhancements)

### Modified Methods:
1. **`sort_page(page)`** - Updated turnus name extraction logic to use new dynamic method
2. **`plasseringslogikk_tid(word, uke, dag, turnus)`** - Added cell boundary detection and improved time splitting logic

### Enhanced Parameters:
- Text extraction now uses `x_tolerance=3, y_tolerance=2` for better word capture

## Testing Results

Tested with: `app/static/turnusfiler/r26/turnuser_R26.pdf`

Results:
- ✅ 57 turnuser successfully extracted
- ✅ Turnus names correctly captured (e.g., "OSL_01", "OSL_02")
- ✅ Split times correctly placed across day boundaries
- ✅ Shift codes properly extracted
- ✅ JSON and Excel files generated successfully

## Backward Compatibility

All improvements maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing placement logic for times and dagsverk preserved
- File structure and output format unchanged
- Command-line interface remains the same
- No breaking changes to JSON/Excel output structure

## Usage

The script works exactly as before:

```bash
# Command line
python shiftscraper.py path/to/file.pdf R26

# Programmatic
from app.utils.shiftscraper import ShiftScraper
scraper = ShiftScraper()
scraper.scrape_pdf('file.pdf', 'R26')
scraper.create_json(year_id='R26')
scraper.create_excel(year_id='R26')
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:
- OCR fallback for poorly scanned PDFs
- Machine learning for adaptive cell boundary detection
- Support for different PDF layouts/formats
- Automatic validation of extracted data against known patterns
