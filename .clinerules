# Project: Shift Rotation Organizer
# Stack: Python/Flask, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2 templates, Bootstrap 5

## Response Guidelines
- Be concise. Skip preamble and summaries.
- Show only changed code, not entire files.
- Use minimal context in diffs (3 lines).
- Don't repeat the question or explain what you're about to do.
- Don't add docstrings/comments unless asked.
- One-line answers for simple questions.
- No "Here's the code" or "I'll help you with" phrases.
- Omit obvious imports unless they're new.
- Don't show unchanged functions.
- Skip confirmation messages like "Done!" or "Let me know if...".

## Code Style
- Follow existing patterns in codebase.
- No over-engineering or unsolicited refactoring.
- Flask blueprints in app/routes/, utils in app/utils/.
- Use existing decorators/helpers before creating new ones.
- Match existing error handling patterns.
- Norwegian UI text, English code/comments.

## Project Structure
- Models: app/models.py
- Forms: app/forms.py
- Templates: app/templates/
- Email templates: app/templates/emails/
- Database utils: app/utils/db_utils.py

## Assumptions (don't ask, just do)
- Use current_user from flask_login for auth.
- Use flash() for user messages.
- Use db.session for database operations.
- Assume Bootstrap 5 classes in templates.

## UI/Template Style
- Use modern card-based design from app/static/css/auth.css for forms/pages.
- Always use shared CSS files instead of inline <style> blocks.
- CSS files go in app/static/css/.
- Include Bootstrap Icons (bi-*) for form fields and buttons.
- Use floating labels pattern for form inputs.
- Standalone pages (login, register, etc.): link CSS directly in <head>.
- Pages extending base.html: use {% block extra_css %} for additional CSS.
- Follow existing color scheme: purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2).
- Use .modern-card, .card-header-modern, .form-control-modern classes.
- Norwegian text for all UI labels and messages.

## DRY Principles
- Extract repeated CSS to shared files in app/static/css/.
- Extract repeated HTML patterns to Jinja2 macros or includes.
- Reuse existing form field patterns from auth templates.
- Check for existing utilities before creating new ones.

## Don't
- Suggest tests unless asked.
- Add logging unless asked.
- Create new files when editing existing ones works.
- Explain Flask/SQLAlchemy basics.
- Add type hints unless codebase uses them.
- Use inline CSS when a shared CSS file exists for that purpose.
